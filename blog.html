I get calls daily from folks around Pittsburg saying, 'Dean, I bought Starlink, set it in the yard, and it drops connection constantly.'</p><p>Starlink satellites move fast across the sky. Your dish needs a wide, clear field of view to track them. If a single pine branch is in that path, the signal gets cut until it finds the next satellite.</p><p>The solution isn't cutting down the forest; it's getting above it. I specialize in high-mount installations. Whether it's a ridge mount on your roof or a pole mount, getting that dish 10 feet higher usually solves the obstruction issue entirely.</p>"

                body: "<p>I had a customer in Mt. Pleasant tell me they thought their house was haunted. Every time the microwave ran, the living room lights would dim. That's not a ghost; that's a loose neutral wire.</p><p>Your electrical system relies on a neutral wire to balance the load. If that connection gets loose at the meter base or in your panel, the voltage goes haywire. This can fry your electronics instantly.</p><p>More importantly, the arcing at the loose connection creates heat that can start a fire in your walls. Do not ignore flickering lights.</p>"

                body: "<p>We don't get hard winters often, but when that arctic blast hits Pittsburg, RVers suffer. The thin underbelly of a camper offers almost zero protection for PEX pipes.</p><p>When the wind whips under your rig, it freezes your water lines almost instantly. The solution is RV skirting. It traps the heat radiating from your floor and creates a dead air space.</p><p>It also drastically cuts down on your propane usage.

The standard router isn't going to punch through your house walls and travel that far.</p><p>The solution isn't digging a trench. It's a Wireless Point-to-Point Bridge.

Our water has minerals that settle over time.</p><p>This layer traps steam bubbles against the burner. It insulates the water from the heat, making your bill go up and eventually cracking the tank.</p><p>Flush your tank annually. It's messy, but cheaper than a new heater.</p>"
